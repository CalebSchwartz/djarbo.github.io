The late 1990's and early 2000's were an exciting time to be growing up around technology. My infatuation with computers began around this time, and it began innocuously enough: Backyard Baseball, Freddy Fish, the usual suspects. To me, they were magic. I couldn't fathom what made them work; all that mattered to me was that they did.

My first exposure to any sort of "programming" began when I got a bit older. I was a voracious reader, and Wikipedia provided the perfect medium to learn about new things. Eventually I started editing and enjoyed tinkering with the pages, which allow for some HTML and a proprietery markup language similar to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I love running. So much, in fact, that I compete in track and cross country for my college. Though it can be difficult to do my best academic work at all times through weekly training and travel to competitions, I don't doubt this has contributed tremendously to my time-management skills. I don't regret a moment of my opportunities to run.

My other hobbies include music, playing guitar, chess, reading, and [Rocket League](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) when I get the chance. Highly recommended.

## This Site

Originally. I was hosting this on AWS using a full blown (micro) ec2 server instance. After racking up a bill of a whole $0.52 however, I realized this was far more than I would ever need for my personal portfolio. I decided to switch over to a simple S3 bucket to host my static pages, and eventually GitHub Pages became my tool of choice.

Eventually, thanks to Antriksh Yadev's [brilliant article and blog](http://antrikshy.com/about/this-site) I was inspired to use a modified and customized Jekyll bundle to keep everything organized. In short: Jekyll is a static site generator geared towards building blogs, but by making some tweaks to the Sass stylesheets and default HTML layouts you can do some really cool stuff. Jekyll has exposed me to Sass and has really encouraged me to avoid duplicating code (even the hex value of a repeatedly used color). I definitely encourage you to check out Antriksh's site if you're new to web development and want inspiration to start building cool stuff.

On my page footer are links to my public GitHub account as well as my LinkedIn. The majority of my coursework from Cal Poly is kept within private repositories to protect academic integrity, but I will provide it upon request.
