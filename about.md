I'm Devon, a third-year at [Cal Poly](http://calpoly.edu), where I major in Computer Science and minor in Economics. I cannot imagine being at a different school at this stage; the degree to which I have developed as a person during my time as a student astonishes me as I reflect on it.

I love running. So much, in fact, that I compete in track and cross country for my college. Traveling to competitions and training makes it challenging for me to do my very best academic work at all times, but this has contributed tremendously to my time-management skills. I don't regret a moment of my opportunities to run.

My other hobbies include music, playing guitar, chess, reading, and [Rocket League](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) when I get the chance. Highly recommended.
