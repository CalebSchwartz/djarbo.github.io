The late 1990's and early 2000's were an exciting time to be growing up around technology. My infatuation with computers began around this time, and it began innocuously enough: Backyard Baseball, Freddy Fish, the usual suspects.

My first "exposure" to any sort of programming began when I got a bit older. I was a voracious reader, and Wikipedia gave me a good outlet to learn about new things. Eventually this turned to editing, and 

I love running. So much, in fact, that I compete in track and cross country for my college. Traveling to competitions and training makes it challenging for me to do my very best academic work at all times, but this has contributed tremendously to my time-management skills. I don't regret a moment of my opportunities to run.

My other hobbies include music, playing guitar, chess, reading, and [Rocket League](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) when I get the chance. Highly recommended.

### This Site

Originally. I was hosting this on AWS using a full blown (micro) ec2 server instance. After racking up a bill of a whole $0.52 however, I realized this was far more than I would ever need for my personal portfolio. I decided to switch over to a simple S3 bucket to host my static pages, and eventually GitHub Pages became my tool of choice.

Eventually, thanks to Antriksh Yadev's [brilliant article and blog](http://antrikshy.com/about/this-site) I was inspired to use a modified and customized Jekyll bundle to keep everything organized. In short: Jekyll is a static site generator geared towards building blogs, but by making some tweaks to the Sass stylesheets and default HTML layouts you can do some really cool stuff. Jekyll has exposed me to Sass and has really encouraged me to avoid duplicating code (even the hex value of a repeatedly used color). I definitely encourage you to check out Antriksh's site if you're new to web development and want inspiration to start building cool stuff.

On my page footer are links to my public GitHub account as well as my LinkedIn. The majority of my coursework from Cal Poly is kept within private repositories to protect academic integrity, but I will provide it upon request.
