### [Mustang Marks](https://github.com/JuicyPasta/DNDHackathon)

Some friends and I redesigned and implemented new UI for the widely used professor ratings site among students at Cal Poly called PolyRatings. We initially built the project at a hackathon, but continued development for some time afterwards during the quarter. Most of my work involved parsing ratings data from the existing site.
