### [Mustang Marks](https://github.com/JuicyPasta/DNDHackathon)

Some friends and I redesigned and implemented new UI for the widely used professor ratings site among students at Cal Poly called PolyRatings. We initially built the project at a hackathon, but continued development for some time afterwards during the quarter. Most of my work involved parsing ratings data from the existing site.

### My Personal Site

If you are curious, I am hosting these pages using a combination of GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I have some more information about this process and what inspired it on [my about page](/about/).
