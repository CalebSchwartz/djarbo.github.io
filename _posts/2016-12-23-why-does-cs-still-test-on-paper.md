title: Why Do C.S. Courses Still Test On Paper?
---

Paper and pencil exams in a Computer Science course. I must ask, why?

This is something many of my classmates and I have groaned about for a number of years without really coming up with a good justification. Off the cuff, I can think of about three possible rationale:

1. It is easier to supervise and proctor a written exam.
2. It is harder to cheat on a written exam.
3. It is simpler to administer a written exam.

(more to come soon)
