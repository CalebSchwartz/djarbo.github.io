title: Why Do C.S. Courses Administer Paper Exams?
---

I've always felt like paper and pencil exams are growing a bit archaic in computer science cirriculum.

This is something many of my classmates and I have groaned about for a number of years without really coming up with a perfect justification. Off the cuff, I can think of about three possible rationale:

1. It is easier to supervise and proctor a written exam.
2. It is harder to cheat on a written exam.
3. It is simpler to administer a written exam.

After reading some of what Gayle Laakmann McDowell wrote in [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) about technical interviews and the imperfect science of assessing the quality of a software engineering candidate, it makes a bit more sense. Obviously, text editors, IDEs, and the convenience of syntax highlighting and autocomplete functionality have lulled us all as programmers into poor habits. I speak from experience when I say it can be easy to forget the precise names of lesser-known, but standard Java functions because IntelliJ or Eclipse always finishes it after typing three characters. Writing code by hand on a whiteboard challenges us to try to be the best version of ourselves that we possibly can be. Writing code on a whiteboard slows our cramping hand down and forces us to think carefully, to critically analyze each statement we place 

The reservation I have with this philosophy is that programming is, much like assessing candidates in a technical interview, an imperfect science. There is no such thing as "perfect" code. Yet, in an effort to produce the best code we can, we automate some of the mindless tasks that present opportunity for human error by allowing the editor to complete parentheses or function names.
